## Hi there 👋
I am Kate Carr.
A data scientist passionate about using **machine learning** and **natural language processing** to solve real-world problems. I work with both **R** and **Python**, and my interests span across predictive modeling, financial and medical applications, and knowledge-augmented systems.

### 🔍 Current Interests
- 🔎 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** (project in progress!)
- 🌍 **Spatiotemporal analysis and modeling** (currently learning!)

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
`Python` • `R` • `scikit-learn` • `tidymodels` • `PyTorch`  • `transformers` 

### 📁 Projects
- 🔬 **Alzheimer’s Early Detection**: Leveraging ensemble learning for medical prediction tasks
- 📷 **Motus Dataset Image Classification**: Multi-class classification of movie scenes for social impact
- 🗂️ **LeanDomainRAG**: Optimized Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for SEC Variable Insurance Products
